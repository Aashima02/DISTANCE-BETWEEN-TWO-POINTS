# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Import math function.
### Step 2: 
Assign the values of point 1 and point 2 whose distance is to be calculated.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)

### Step 4: 
Print the coding to get the answer.
### Step 5: 
End the program.

import math
a = [10,6]
b = [4,2]
value = math.sqrt(((b[0]-a[0])**2)+((b[1]-a[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(value))
```
